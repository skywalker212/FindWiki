# FindWiki

This a web page that searches for wikipidia articles for a given query.  

##### I have to fulfil these [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)  
  - I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.  
  - I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.  

I'll be using various APIs to get the job done.  

You can drop me a mail at akashgajjar8@gmail.com for any suggestions or queries.  

Peace (Y)
